    \vfill\noindent

    We ask that the eScience Institute at the University of Washington sponsor the first annual Scientific Python Developer Summit by providing workspaces for up to forty participants, who will develop shared infrastructure for libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem. The week-long summit will take place sometime between February and June 2023.

# Goals

The Scientific Python Developer Summit provides an opportunity for core developers
from the scientific Python ecosystem to come together to:

## Improve joint infrastructure

Collaborate to adopt and improve infrastructure, tools, and processes
used across projects. This includes infrastructure already described
by Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents (SPECs), as well
as, but not limited to, tools for documentation, testing, packaging,
and Continuous Integration (CI).

```
Re-usable libraries with commonly used functionality
Shared build system for binary packaging
Integrated websites and expanded documentation
Shared benchmarking
Developer Operations (DevOps)
```

## Better coordinate core projects

- Community best operating and development practices manual
- Coordinated release schedule
- Regular cross-project communication
- Joint governance structures

## Work on a shared developer roadmap

Our community has never before engaged in a deliberative process to try and anticipate future challenges.  
The strategic plan will identify core needs and future challenges of
the scientific Python community. Rather than focusing on the technical details of one particular core project, the strategic plan would discuss the challenges shared by more projects. The plan will also be used by the community
for support when applying for federal grants.

# Logistics

We have funding to cover 40—no more than 50—participants for 5 days,
6 nights, including travel, food, and lodging.
This will be an invite-only event that requires a substantial upfront agreement to commit a substantial amount of time including:

- in-person participation in one-week developer summit
- three to four month pre-summit planning
- three to four moutht post-summit implementation

## Timing

We need four months lead time, but assuming we get an early confirmation we would like a one-week
period between February and June 2023.

## Pre-Summit Planning

Participants will be responsible for attending two or more one-hour video meetings and
participating in a planning repository via PRs, issues, as well as PR and issue reviews.
In particular, the work plan will be decided before the meeting.

This includes deciding on topics, dividing the work, and scheduling the meeting.

## Summit Execution

No specific need for everyone to meet at once.
We will plan to have several small work groups.

Lunch could be catered and delivered to the work rooms or we could go to near by restaurants.

## Post-Summit Implementation
