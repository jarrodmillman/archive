Dear Scientific Python contributor,

Given your involvement with the Scientific Python project and your contributions to the larger ecosystem, we
are excited to invite you to the first annual Scientific Python Developer Summit (May 22-26, 2023), hosted by
the eScience Institute at the University of Washington.

The aim of the summit is to provide a collaborative space where you
can make progress on ecosystem projects you care about or are working
on already.

We have funding to cover 40 participants for five days and six nights including travel, food, and lodging.
Due to space and funding constraints, as well as the fact that this is our first summit, this is an invite-only
event that requires upfront commitment to:
(a) take part in two of the three one-hour pre-summit planning meetings,
(b) collaborate with fellow participants on a work plan,
(c) attend the one-week summit in-person, and
(d) participate, to whatever degree possible, in several months of post-summit implementation.

As mentioned above, instead of amounting to extra work, the idea is to
provide a space for you to complete work you are already doing.
The meeting will largely be self-organized, and the work done will
depend on what participants choose to focus on.

Please see the attached document for additional details, and please
let us know whether you can commit to participating in this year's
summit by Sunday, January 22nd.

Best regards,
Brigitta, Stefan, and Jarrod
