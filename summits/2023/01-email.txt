Dear Scientific Python contributor,

Given your involvement with the Scientific Python project and your contributions to the larger ecosystem, we
are happy to invite you to the first annual Scientific Python Developer Summit (May 22-26, 2023) hosted by
the eScience Institute at the University of Washington.

We have funding to cover 40 participants for five days and six nights including travel, food, and lodging.
Due to space and funding constraints as well as the fact that this is our first summit, this is an invite-only
event that requires upfront agreement to commit a substantial amount of time to
(a) take part in two of the three pre-summit planning meetings,
(b) interact with fellow participants in the public forums,
(c) attend the one-week summit in-person, and
(d) participate in several months of post-summit implementation.

This may sound like a lot of additional work, but the idea is that you would be working on things that you
are already working on. The meeting will largely be self-organized and the work depend on what the participants
choose to focus on.

Please see the attached document for addtional details and let us know whether you can commit to participating in this year's summit by Sunday, January 22nd.

Best regards,
Brigitta, Stefan, and Jarrod
