## Title



## Short Summary

<!--
The brief description which will appear in the online program and give
attendees a basic sense of your talk. This should be around 100 words or less.
-->


## Abstract

<!--
Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your abstract.
This should be a roughly 500 word outline of your presentation. This outline
should concisely describe software of interest to the SciPy community, tools or
techniques for more effective computing, or how scientific Python was applied
to solve a research problem. A traditional background/motivation, methods,
results, and conclusion structure is encouraged but not required. Links to
project websites, source code repositories, figures, full papers, and evidence
of public speaking ability are encouraged.
