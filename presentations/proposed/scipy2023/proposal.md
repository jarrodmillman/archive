# SciPy 2022 Proposal

Jul 11-16, 2023

https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/present

## Title

Scientific Python---Year in Review

## Session type

Talk (30 minutes)

## Abstract (100 words)

The Scientific Python project aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community.
This talk focuses on our efforts to better coordinate project development, and to improve shared infrastructure.
Come hear about our goals, our recent technical work, and learn how you can get involved!

## Description (500 words)

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way toward a unified, expanded scientific Python community.
It focuses its efforts along two primary axes: _(i)_ to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and _(ii)_ to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical infrastructure and tools.

Last year we launched with new websites, a new theme, a social media campaign, and a collaborative coordination process.
CZI has funded continued development, maintainence, and support for the themes and community infrastructure.
Now that the community and communication infrastructure has support for the next few years,
we will focus more on technical topics and the SPECs.

As a first step, we have started working on sparse arrays in scipy with the goal of removing
sparse matrices and eventually numpy matrices.
Mention sparse summit.
And how sparse arrays touches multiple projects, numpy, scipy, scikit-images, networkx, scikit-learn, and all the packages built on top of these packages.

In addition to the sparse summit, we have had a domain summit and the first annual developer summit.
The first annual developer summit brought together over 30 community members for a week-long collaborative
developer sprint.

Finally, we will update the community on our progress on the decadal plan.

- CZI grant w/ Quansight (building on the work from last year)
