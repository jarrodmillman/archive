## Title

Scientific Python---Year in Review

## Session type

Talk (30 minutes)

## Abstract (100 words)

The Scientific Python project aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community.
This talk focuses on our efforts to better coordinate project development, and to improve shared infrastructure.
Come hear about our goals, our recent technical work, and learn how you can get involved!

## Description (500 words)

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way towards a unified, expanded scientific Python community.
It focuses its efforts along two primary axes: _(i)_ to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and _(ii)_ to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical infrastructure and tools.
