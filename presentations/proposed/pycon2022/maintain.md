# PyCon 2022 Proposal

April 24th--29th, 2022

https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/maintainers-summit/

## Title

Scientific Python: Past, Future, and Present

## Topic summary

## Key takeaways (why/how it benefits the Maintainers Summit audience)

## Outline of your talk

## Abstract (max 300 words in length)

The Scientific Python ecosystem is a loose federation of libraries written by
volunteers for use by themselves and the community. It is now the de facto
platform for scientific research and data science. In this talk I discuss how a
small, unfunded, community effort managed to succeed against the odds; the
challenges it faces; what can be done (by us, by you!) to make it better; and
what lies on the road ahead.
