# SciPy 2021 Proposal

Jul 6-10, 2020

## Title

The Next Decade of Scientific Python

## Short Summary

<!--
The brief description which will appear in the online program and give
attendees a basic sense of your talk. This should be around 100 words or less.
-->

To better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python for the next
decade, the "The Next Decade of Scientific Python" project
(https://scientific-python.org/) will:

- Create recommendation infrastructure for community-wide policy,
- Improve common engineering infrastructure,
- Organize a series of developer events to discuss needs,
- Write a community vetted strategic plan, and
- Help the community develop grant proposals.

In this talk, I will describe our three-year plan, the work we have already
begun, and how projects can become more engaged with the project.

## Abstract

<!--
Your placement in the program will be based on reviews of your abstract. This
should be a roughly 500 word outline of your presentation. This outline should
concisely describe software of interest to the SciPy community, tools or
techniques for more effective computing, or how scientific Python was applied
to solve a research problem. A traditional background/motivation, methods,
results, and conclusion structure is encouraged but not required. Links to
project websites, source code repositories, figures, full papers, and evidence
of public speaking ability are encouraged.

- In your abstract, be sure to include answers to some basic questions:

  - Who is the intended audience for your talk?
  - What, specifically, will attendees learn from your talk?

- Ensure that your talk will be relevant to a broad range of people. If your
  talk is on a particular Python package or piece of software, it should useful
  to more than a niche group.

- Include links to source code, articles, blog posts, or other writing that
  adds context to the presentation.

With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis. This ecosystem is
sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing lists, websites,
roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions, and governance
structures.
Our project (https://scientific-python.org/) aims to better coordinate the
ecosystem and prepare scientific Python for the next decade.

Our first step was to create a new recommendation infrastructure for community-wide policy
and on improving common engineering infrastructure.
These documents are called Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) documents
(https://scientific-python.org/specs/).
We also recruited several community members to serve as a SPEC Steering Committee
and to bootstrap the work.

Next we will organize a series of developer summits and an annual three-day
forum of community leaders.
We will use these summits and the annual forum to help us prepare a community
vetted strategic plan as well as help the community develop grant proposals to
fund future work.

While we have reached out to a number of projects and community members about
this effort, we would like to make the official announcement at SciPy 2021.

In my talk, I will explain what we have done and our future plans in detail.
This is talk is aimed at maintainers and core contributors.
It is intended to not only raise awareness of the project, but I will also
tell attendees how they can get involved.


<!--
It is a new project and a new opportunity for people to make a big impact
on the ecosystem.
So while it will mainly be focused on current maintainers and contributors,
I will also talk about how new community members can get involved.

BOF? We should definitely orgarnize one
